/**
 * This game consists of the user flinging disks into the air trying to hit
 * a (red) target square without hitting static blocking element, initiallysquares. 
 * If it does hit a static object, it becomes static itself making it harder
 * to get to the target.  The user can grab a disk in flight and refling it
 * but cannot drag it around the screen. The level ends when the target is hit
 * and the game goes to the next level.
 * 
 * This game is a sketetal version of a simple game that was developed
 * as part of Programming Assignment 3 for the Brandeis University JBS
 * in Summer of 2011.
